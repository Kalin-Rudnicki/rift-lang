/*
give no control over method/method!
you can only define "method", but by defining "method", you also define "method!"
should ! be opposite of ruby!
this is only the case for instance methods.
return type is same as before, but with an additional return of the duplication
have some sort of keyword to change this behavior

only do this if there is modification to any instance variables

how to deal with map would need to map to the same type, and map! could be to anything?
