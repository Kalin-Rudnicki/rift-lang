Compilation:

Consider 3 files: A, B, C
A includes B and C

B   C
 \ /
  A

C can not use functions declared in B
if B and C declare the same function or class, it is an error

...

Now consider a 4th file D...

  D
 / \
B   C
 \ /
  A

Lets say that B redefines a function declared in D
there are a few options for how C should see this:
	1) error
	2) warning - use old
	3) warning - use new
